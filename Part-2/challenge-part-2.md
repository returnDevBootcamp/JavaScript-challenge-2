## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Two (Part two)💪🏾

There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
A team **only** wins if it has at least **double** the average score of the other team. 
Otherwise, no team wins!

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Create an arrow function `calcAverage` to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function `checkWinner` that takes the average score of each team as parameters (`avgReds` and `avgBlues`), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. 
Example: "Reds win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the `checkWinner` function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time

Good Luck 😀
